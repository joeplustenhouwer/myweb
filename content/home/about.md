# About me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bamberg, and part of the Bamberg Research Group on Behavioral Macroeconomics (BaGBeM).

My general approach in research  is to incorporate behavioral and bounded rationality features into macroeconomic modelling. I believe that new insights can be obtained by also considering models that deviate from the fully rational representative agent that  optimizes over an infinite planning horizon. I am especially interested in studying issues and models that concern monetary and fiscal policy. My aim is to use a bounded rationality to gain new insights that are relevant for policy makers.
