# About me

I am an assistant professor (Jun.Prof.) in macroeconomics at Heidelberg University.

My research focuses on expectation formation and its implications for macroeconomics. I use complementary methodologies by empirically analyzing survey expectations, conducting controlled laboratory experiments, and incorporating bounded rationality into macroeconomic modelling. I believe that important new insights can be obtained by considering models that deviate from the fully rational representative agent that  optimizes over an infinite planning horizon. I am especially interested in studying issues and models that concern monetary and fiscal policy. My aim is to use a bounded rationality approach obtain findings that are relevant for policy makers.
