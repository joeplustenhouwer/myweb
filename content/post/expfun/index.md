The University of Bamberg funds a joint project with Tomasz Makarewicz, Christian Proa&#xf1;o and Juan Carlos Pe&#xf1;a,    titled '<i>Are Some People More Equal than Others? Experimental Evidence on Group Identity and Income Inequality</i>.'

The committee for research and young talent (FNK) of the University of Bamberg selected the proposal sent by Tomasz Makarewicz and myself and decided to fund our experiment. In this project we will test whether political polarization and an unwillingness for redistribution are mainly driven by economic incentives, or mainly by social identity and group formation. We are eager to proceed with coding and running the experiment and look forward to the results.
