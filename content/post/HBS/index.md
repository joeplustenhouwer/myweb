I have received funding from the <a href="https://www.boeckler.de/en/index.htm">Hans Böckler Foundation</a> for a junior research group with three PhD students for the duration of three years. The topic of the junior research group is “Expectation Formation in Macroeconomics and its Implications for Monetary and Fiscal Policy”. The PhD students will analyze expectations survey data, conduct laboratory experiment and build macroeconomicmodels to advance the understanding of macroeconomic expectations and give policy recommendations. The funding includes scholarships and traveling budgets for the PhD students as well as funds to organize workshops.
