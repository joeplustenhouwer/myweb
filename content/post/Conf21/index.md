With great pleasure, I want to draw your attention to the  <a href="https://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/060322/Promotionskolleg_Makrooekonomik/Bamberg2019_Call_for_Papers.pdf">call for papers</a> of the Second Behavioral Macroeocnomcis Workshop, that we are organizing  in the city of Bamberg on <b>June 14 and 15</b>.

I really enjoyed the high quality presentations and interesting conversations of last year's edition, and I am confident that this year's workshop will be even better. The theme of the workshop will be '<i>Heterogeneity and Expectations in Macroeconomics and Finance</i>'. As indicated in the call for papers, however, we encourage submissions from a broader spectrum of behavioral macroeconomics and finance topics.

Confirmed Keynote speakers are <b>George W. Evans</b> and <b>Domenico Delli Gatti</b>. More information can be found on the  <a href="https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/bamberg-graduate-schools-promotionsprogramme/promotionskolleg-makrooekonomik/events/second-behavioral-macroeconomics-workshop/">conference website</a>.
